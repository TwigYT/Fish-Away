# Fish Away - Forge

### A general fishing/resource gathering mod for 1.20.1

## Features

This mod is still in development and many new features might be added in the future. For now the features include:

* Biomes: The only Biome in the game as of right now is the fisherman's beach! But it is slightly broken. (Will not generate next to the ocean yet, and driftwood trees are not generating.)

* Items: there are only a handful of items right now in the mod, this includes Driftwood Scraps, and the pear.

* Tools: You can craft the Iron Fishing Rod (durability: 128), the Golden Fishing Rod (durability: 18, gives you luck), the Diamond Fishing Rod (durability: 384), and the Netherite Fishing Rod (durability: 400, Immune to fire, Gives you strength.)

* Ores: there is a small chance that diamond ore will get replaced with a diamond chunk that gives you three diamonds when broken. and the same with emeralds.

## Issues/Questions

If you have any issues, bugs, and/or suggestions, please put them in the comments.
Hopefully soon I will have a GitHub page where you can report bugs.

## Fabric?

Once the next stable MCreator release comes out I will hopefully try to port the mod to fabric.
